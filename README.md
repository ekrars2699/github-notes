1. Git is a version control software. Version control keeps tracks of the history and all of the versions that you make. It makes it so you don't have to manually have to keep track of all your versions. The other key thing of Git is collaboration. This allows multiple people to work together on one project at the same time. 
2. Github is a web service which allows people to use the software, Git, on a site.
3. Repo is shortended for repository. It's a project which can have multiple files in it. You can add files to the repo.
4. Commit is saving the changes you make to your files. Commit's can have a note/description of what the change is. Each commit allows you to see the history of all changes to the file. All commits have a unique hash with them.
